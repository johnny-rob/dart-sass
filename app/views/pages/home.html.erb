<h2>Is you're house an asset or a liablity?</h2>

<h2>Are you sure?</h2>

<h4>What is house hacking?</h4>
<p>House hacking is the idea of utilizing a house as a true asset rather than the liability that it typically is.  We've all heard a house is an asset, and that isn't entirely untrue, but it is misleading.  Simply owning a house and living in it means that the house is a liability up to the point that it is sold.  At the point of sale, it switches to an asset because it has been a store of value during the duration of ownership.  All of the principal that was paid during that time, along with any appreciation in value, combines to create a return on ownership.

However, if a house is sold for less than the purchase value plus any additional investments in the house, then it was a liability only because the owner has lost money.  A critical point to understand, assets make you money liabilities cost you money.

The term house hacking has recently come into vogue in the popular lexicon, referring to the idea of turning a property into an asset during the period of ownership rather than at the point of sale.  This can be done in a variety of ways, but almost all involve some form of renting the home out.  The idea is especially popular among adhereants of the FIRE (Finanical Independance Retire Early) movement as it provides a second revenue stream alongside an existing job or business.  It also attracts a lot of DIYers (Do It Yourself), as making improviments on the home yourself, rather than hiring a contractor can save you a great deal of money, while improving the rental or resale value of the house substantially.
